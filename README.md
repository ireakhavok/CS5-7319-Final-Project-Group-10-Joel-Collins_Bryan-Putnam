************************* How to Run

Download the project click on Solution (.sln) file and run. It will compile the code automatically. 


We are planning on creating a class library written in C# to interface with the APIâ€™s. We will be coding in C# and using the framework .NET 6, a cross-platform coding standard that allows for multiple types of architectures and frameworks. With one of the Web-based frameworks, ASP.NET, Multiple architectural styles have been Included, like Model View Controller (MVC), which is actually an MVVM architecture, Server-only processing, and Client-Server processing. These are all renditions layer-based and component-driven architectures. 
The two Architectural styles we will choose will both utilize the exact same class library for the API calls, which is layered and component-based, but also utilizes the architecture of the internet with cookies, HTTP GET, and POST commands via REST API style architecture.  The Inputs of this layer will be Login/ Password information (encrypted) and method calls, and the output of this will be essentially a shared memory architecture, and Boolean variables indicating success. 
The difference in the two different implementations of the program is that they will completely utilize different front-end implementation frameworks. 
One will use a component-based layered architectural style done in Windows Forms, a native windows application, but with a side-loaded HTML viewer component called WebView2, which is a .net framework plugin based on Microsoft Edge. The main layers at the low-level implementation will be: a presentation layer, interface layer, a possible business layer (not currently utilized, but may be needed to meet uncommitted goals), and a link to the data-access layer. This final DAL layer will be in the Class library used in both architectures.
In this implementation there will be multiple presentation layers: one for authentication, one for login, and one for presentation of the game information itself. Behind each presentation layer item there will be an interface layer for the action routing of that specific Windows Forms based view. The uncommitted, but planned part of this application will include a chat feature with friends, however this implementation may need access to a payment only, C++ based, Partner level API, which I have recently applied for, but have not yet received the acceptance letter for access. This API is generally used in actual video games for speaking directly with steam servers to route messages and invites from friends in the Steam Network. 
The other will utilize a complex web-based Client-Server, and Server-Server Architecture, with either REST-based MVC style architecture or purely REST-Based Controller architecture. In the Uncommitted example of this architecture, there will need to be Client processing written in C# but presented to the client as JavaScript code in order to hash and properly secure passwords for transmission across the internet to the Server, and then to the REST based API. But, because this code will be only transmitting locally to the server, this is an extended goal for hopes of actual deployment to a real web service. 
This will have a similarly based GUI architecture, but follow a REST-like structure to interact with the other layers. This part of the implementation 
We will refrain from using external packages, and not use any third-party frameworks or libraries to accomplish these goals. But, Because the C# language heavily relies on and strongly suggests coding standards which require the use of class structures, we will be coding the layers as classes but just as a nominal and organizational relation, not as a functional requirement.  Some low-level objects that absolutely require class structure, will also be object-oriented, to organize them for data binding to UI elements. 
We chose an event-based gui because it is perfect for GUI driven applications, and we chose to try out a client server based architecture because that architecture is perfect for web applications, which this is technically a combination of both, so we wanted to see which architecture would be better.
